1. Security (Sandbox Model)

- Applets are not allowed to:
a) Access or modify files on the user’s computer.
b) Connect to any server other than the one they were
downloaded from.


2. Modern Replacement
- Modern web technologies that replaced applets:
• HTML5
• CSS3
• JavaScript

Example:
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can animate text easily.


3. Legacy Importance
- It’s important for developers to understand applets because:
• They were an early example of web-embedded Java code.
• Understanding them helps us see how web technology evolved.
• Many legacy systems in old enterprises may still have appletbased
interfaces.
